 * This file defines the types and macros necessary for fixed-point arithmetic
 * operations. The library provides efficient computation for systems that may
 * lack hardware floating-point support or require precise numerical computations.
 *
 * The fixed-point format is represented using 16 fractional bits, allowing for
 * a trade-off between range and precision. This header includes conversion macros
 * between integers, fixed-point numbers, and floating-point numbers.
