# Fixed-Point

## Overview

The Fixed-Point is an educational project designed to help understand and implement fixed-point arithmetic in C and C++. Fixed-point arithmetic is a valuable technique for handling real-world applications that require precise numerical calculations without the overhead of floating-point operations.

## Features

- Header file with fixed-point data types and arithmetic functions.
- Example projects showcasing the use of fixed-point arithmetic.
- MIT License for unrestricted educational and experimental use.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/teleprint-me/fixed-point.git
```

2. Explore the `include` directory to find the fixed-point header file.

```sh
cd fixed-point
```

3. Check out the example projects in the `examples` directory for practical usage.

```sh
ls examples
```

4. Feel free to experiment, modify, and build upon the provided code.

```sh
vim examples
```

## Usage

To include the fixed-point arithmetic header in your C/C++ project, simply add:

```c
#include "fixed_point.h"
```
